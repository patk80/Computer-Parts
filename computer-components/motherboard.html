    <h2>About the Motherboard</h2>

    <p>"The official motherboard definition is that it’s the main printed circuit board within a computer, which means it’s the primary piece of circuitry that all of the other pieces plug into to create a cohesive whole. The motherboard is the backbone that ties the computer’s components together at one spot and allows them to talk to each other. Without it, none of the computer pieces, such as the CPU, GPU, or hard drive, could interact. Total motherboard functionality is necessary for a computer to work well." &mdash; <a href="https://store.hp.com/us/en/tech-takes/what-does-a-motherboard-do#:~:text=The%20motherboard%20is%20the%20backbone,or%20hard%20drive%2C%20could%20interact.">HP</a></p>
